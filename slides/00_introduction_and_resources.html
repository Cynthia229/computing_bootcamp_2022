## Welcome

Welcome to the Department of Statistical Science (DSS). The following slides,
slide decks, and exercises will serve to

- give you an understanding of the computing resources available to you within 
  the DSS and Duke University;
  
- inform you on the best way to get help with your computing needs within the 
  DSS and Duke University;
  
- introduce you to R, Python, and version control with Git/GitHub;

- highlight the importance of reproducible research and how the aforementioned
  software can help.

# Duke Computing Resources

---

## Duke NetID

Your Duke NetID is the electronic key to making many Duke resources work.  
Make sure your Duke Account has been setup.

All of the following can be accomplished at 
https://idms-web.oit.duke.edu/portal/:

  - Changing your password
  
  - Changing your challenge questions
  
  - Setting up multi-factor authentication

---

## Duke email

With your NetID and password, you can access your email on the web at
http://mail.duke.edu

**Your Duke email is not permanent; your account expires once you leave Duke.**

---

## Duke WiFi

Duke network connections:

- Dukeblue:

    - 24-hour access to secure (encrypted) wireless throughout Duke's 
      residence halls, academic and administrative buildings

- DukeOpen:

    - unencrypted wireless access for devices such as gaming systems, or 
      other devices

- Eduroam (education roaming):

    - secure (encrypted) wireless access using your Duke NetID and password
    
    - To use eduroam at a participating institution, configure 
      your machine ahead of time while at Duke - 
      https://dukeblue.duke.edu/eduroam/.
      
---

## Duke VPN

- Duke's virtual private network (VPN) allows you to create a secure connection 
  from your computer to Duke over a public network while working remotely. This
  will be necessary for you to use, if you want to access certain Duke and DSS
  resources off campus.

&lt;br/&gt;

- Instructions to get started with the VPN are available on the next slide.
  For more information on Duke's VPN visit
  https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/services/vpn.

---

## Duke VPN set-up

1. Download and install the free Cisco AnyConnect VPN 
   [software](https://software.duke.edu)

2. Launch Cisco AnyConnect on your machine and enter `vpn.duke.edu` in the box.
   Click `Connect`.&lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;center&gt;
   &lt;img src="images/cisco_launch.png" height=150, width=300&gt;
   &lt;/center&gt;
   
3. Another dialog box will appear. Choose `INTL-DUKE` from the dropdown menu
   for `GROUP`, and enter your Duke NetID and password. Click `OK` and you 
   should connect.
   &lt;br/&gt;
   &lt;center&gt;
   &lt;img src="images/cisco_group.png" height=150, width=300&gt;
   &lt;/center&gt;

## Software

- Duke offers software for download to students, faculty, and staff through 
  https://software.duke.edu/

- Duke negotiates with vendors to make software available to the Duke community 
  for discounted rates or, in many cases, for free. If you have any questions, 
  comments or suggestions, please e-mail the site-license office at 
  [site@duke.edu](mailto:site@duke.edu).

- Some free software relevant to you as students: 

  - Microsoft Office
  - MATLAB &amp; Simulink
  - SAS Education Analytical Suite
  - VPN Client
  - Mathematica
  - Tableau
  - Adobe Creative Cloud

## Virtual computing

Duke OIT offers virtual software containers and semester-long virtual machines.

- [Virtual Software Containers](https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers) – 
  Students and instructors can reserve personal computer environments running 
  applications such as RStudio, the Eclipse IDE, Jupyter Notebooks, Matlab, 
  Octave, Mathematica, and others for a semester. These are run through your
  web browser; no software download is required. Two containers you will find
  most useful are:
    
    - `RStudio - statistics application with Rmarkdown and knitr support`
    - `Jupyter - interactive data science and scientific computing notebooks`

- [Virtual Machine (VM)](https://vcm.duke.edu/) – Your Duke VM is like having a 
  second computer that lives with Duke. You can log into and use your VM 
  from your own machine. It allows you to access specialized software without 
  installing it on your own computer, host your own server for development 
  projects and coursework, or customize your own environment to use for the 
  semester.
  
    - Run Windows or Linux VMs
    - Computing resources are light: 2 processors and 2 GB
    
---

## Duke Compute Cluster

The Duke Compute Cluster (DCC) consists of machines that the University has 
provided for community use and that researchers have purchased to conduct their 
research. You will need to be granted access before use.

- Runs on Linux - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

- Offers over 200 compute nodes and over 20,000 cores

- Most nodes are purchased by labs and departments. The DSS has three nodes.

- Uses the SLURM job management system

The [DCC User Guide](https://rc.duke.edu/dcc/dcc-user-guide/) will help you
get up and running. They also host workshops to help new users.

## Getting help with Duke resources

Duke Office of Information Technology (OIT) manages Duke’s technology 
infrastructure and application support.
    
- https://oit.duke.edu/help

- Live chat, 24 hours a day, Monday - Thursday; chat is available on a limited
  basis Fridays and Sundays

- Walk up hours are available at the [Link](https://link.duke.edu/about-link) in 
  [Perkins Library](http://www.google.com/maps?q=William+R.+Perkins+Library,+Durham,+NC&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=36.001827,-78.884911&amp;sspn=0.486055,0.681839&amp;oq=perkins+&amp;hq=William+R.+Perkins+Library,+Durham,+NC&amp;t=m&amp;z=15).

# DSS Computing Resources

---

## RStudio Pro

The DSS has an RStudio Pro license that will allow you to run an instance of
RStudio in your browser while harnessing the computing power of a remote
multiprocessor server.

To access RStudio Pro:

1. If off campus, use the VPN to create a secure connection from your computer 
   to Duke. If you are on campus, be sure you are connected to the Dukeblue
   network.

2. Navigate to one of

    - http://pawn.stat.duke.edu:8787
    - http://rook.stat.duke.edu:8787 (MS students)
    - http://knight.stat.duke.edu:8787 (PhD students)
    
    &lt;i&gt;You'll have access to all three, but we try to spread things out to 
    prevent overload.&lt;/i&gt;

3. Log-in with your Duke NetID and password.
