# Duke University :: Department of Statistical Science Computing Bootcamp 2020

This repository contains the computing bootcamp materials for incoming
Ph.D. and M.S. students to the Department of Statistical Science at
Duke University. These materials are adapted from those developed by
Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Colin Rundel for the
[2018 computing bootcamp](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/computing-bootcamp-2018).

## Getting started

#### Access materials

To get access to the materials, click the green `Code` button, and download a
zip file of this repository. In the version control video and slides
we'll go through the steps of forking and cloning this repository.

#### Contents

In `slides/` you'll find three HTML/PDF slides on the topics below.
1. `00_introduction_and_resources.html` / `00_introduction_and_resources.pdf`
2. `01_r_version_control.html` / `01_r_version_control.pdf`
3. `02_python.html` / `02_python.pdf`

In `exercises/` you'll find one `Rmd` (R Markdown) file and two `ipynb`
(python notebook) files.

At the start of each slide deck are links to companion videos hosted through
Duke's Warpwire platform. The videos serve as supplementary material to the
contents in the slides. It is recommended that you work through the slides
and corresponding videos in the order presented above.

*Solutions to exercises will be added to this repository later in the bootcamp.*
