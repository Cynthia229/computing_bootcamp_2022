# Jupyter notebook

---

## Overview of the notebook

Bimodal interface: edit mode and command mode

<br>

Click in a cell or hit `enter` to enter edit mode
.center[
![](images/edit-mode.png)
]

When in edit mode you can type code or write text with markdown.

<br>

Hit `esc` to enter command mode
.center[
![](images/command_mode.png)
]

When in command mode you can make edits to the notebook, but not individual
cells.

---

## Notebook shortcuts

In **edit** mode:

- Run cell and add new cell: `shift + enter`
- Add a line within a cell: `enter`

--

In **command** mode:

- Save the notebook: `s`
- Change cell to markdown: `m`
- Change cell to code: `y`
- Cut, copy, paste, delete a cell: `x`, `c`, `v`, `d`
- Add a cell above, below: `a`, `b`

<br><br>

The point-and-click interface is also an option to execute these commands.

---

## Jupyter notebook versus R Markdown

- Similar to R Markdown, Jupyter notebooks allow you to write code and text in
  one easy to read document that is reproducible and easy to share with others.

- A Jupyter notebook does not knit to an HTML, PDF or Word file. However, you
  can embed HTML into a notebook.

- For a more detailed comparison see 
  [The First Notebook War](https://yihui.name/en/2018/09/notebook-war/).

# Python basics

---

## Arithmetic operators

Python supports the standard arithmetic operations.

.pull-left[
```{python}
10 + 8
3 - 2
100 / 6
80 * 0
```
]

.pull-right[
```{python}
100 // 3 # integer division
13 % 4   # modulo operator
4 ** 3   # raise to power
```
]

<br/>

*No need to worry about the difference between `int` and `float`.*

---

## Comparison operators

```{python}
5 > 0
4 < 100
3 == 3 # equality
10 <= (5 * 1.9)
0 != 1 # not equal
```

---

Use boolean key words `and`, `or`, and `not` for multiple comparisons.

```{python}
(5 > 10) or (8 / 2 == 4)
True and (8 > 64 ** 0.5)
not True and (8 > 64 ** 0.5)
not (True and (8 > 64 ** 0.5))
```

Parentheses matter. Also, python is case sensitive. True != TRUE unless 
you set a variable TRUE = True which is something you probably shouldn't do.

Operators `&`, `|`, and `^` are bitwise operators; you probably will not need
them. However, these operators are used in R, so try not to get confused.

---

## Python versus R

Key differences in operators in Python versus R.

<br/>

| Operator purpose |  Python |        R                |
|-----------------:|:-------:|:-----------------------:|
|             true |  `True` |  `TRUE`,  `T`           |
|            false | `False` | `FALSE`,  `F`           |
|               or |   `or`  | $\vert$,  $\vert \vert$ |
|              and |  `and`  |       `&`, `&&`         |
|              not |  `not`  |       `!`               |
|           modulo |   `%`   |      `%%`               |
|   exponentiation |   `**`  |       `^`               |
| integer division |   `//`  |      `%/%`              |

---

## Object assignment

Use a single `=` for object assignment.

```{python}
a = 10
a

b = [-10, 0, "computing", "bootcamp", 5 / 2]
b

my_string = "This is a longgggg string"
my_string

nums = list(range(7))
nums
```

---

## Shortcut operation and assignment

Unlike R, Python supports things like

```{python}
a = 5
a += 3
a
```

```{python}
val = 10
val **= 3
val
```

These are equivalent to `a = a + 3` and `val = val ** 3`, respectively.

# Data types and structures

---

## Built-in data structures

Python has four primary built-in data structures.

- **List**: an ordered collection of mutable items

- **Tuple**: an immutable list

- **Dictionary**: an unordered collection of key-value pairs

- **Set**: an unordered collection of unique objects

<br/>

These data structures will generally consist of **integers**, 
**floating point** numbers, **strings**, or **booleans**. 
Using the function `type()` will identify
the data type or structure. 

<br/><br/>

*Hit `p` while viewing the HTML slides for an exhaustive
table of the built-in python data types and structures.*

???

| Data type / structure | Python characterization            |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Text Type:            | `str`                              |
| Numeric Types:        | `int`, `float`, `complex`          |
| Sequence Types:       | `list`, `tuple`, `range`           |
| Mapping Type:         | `dict`                             |
| Set Types:            | `set`, `frozenset`                 |
| Boolean Type:         | `bool`                             |
| Binary Types:         | `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview` |

---

## Lists

- Lists are ordered sequences that can contain a variety of objects, even
  other lists.
  
- A pair of `[` `]` can be used to create a list with each component separated
  by a comma.

- The first item in a list is considered to be in position 0, not position 1.

```{python}
my_list = [9, [1, 1, 1], 10, "swimming", "hiking"]
my_list
```

.pull-left[

Indexing

```{python}
my_list[0]

my_list[-1] 
```
]

.pull-right[

Slicing `start:stop:step`

```{python}
my_list[1:3]
my_list[1:4:2]
```
]

---

## Tuples

- Tuples are similar to lists except that they are immutable. You won't be able
  to reassign something once it exists in a tuple.

- A pair of `(` `)` can be used to create a tuple. Each component is separated
  by a comma.

```{python}
cars = ("subaru", "bmw", "hond", "ford")
cars[3]
```

--

If we try to fix the typo in `cars`, we get

```{python, eval=FALSE}
cars[2] = "honda"
```

`TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment`

---

## Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is 
  connected to a value. The value can be any object you can create in Python.

- Syntax: `{"key_1": value_1, "key_2": value_2}`

```{python}
my_bike = {"model": "trek", "style": "gravel"}
```

--

Subset based on a key

```{python}
my_bike["model"]
```

--

Add a dictionary entry

```{python}
my_bike["year"] = 2020
my_bike
```

---

## Sets

- Sets are an unordered collection of unique objects that can be created with
  a pair of `{` `}`, where each entry is separated by a comma.

- Test for membership and apply set operators that you know from set theory.



```{python}
my_set = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
my_set
```

--

```{python}
list("seewhathappens")
my_set2 = set(list("aabbbbbbbbcddddddde"))
my_set2
```

# Classes, methods, attributes

---

## A brief introduction to OOP

Python is an object oriented programming (OOP) language. Objects can be
categorized by their class type. For each class, there exists a collection of
methods and attributes.

- Methods can be thought of as functions defined for a specific class.

- Attributes can be thought of as variables defined for use with respect to a 
  class.

- To access methods and attributes, type `my_object.<method or attribute>`,
  where after the `.` is the selected method or attribute.

---

## Methods in action

```{python}
my_courses = ["STA523", "STA199", "STA521", "STA601"]
type(my_courses)
```

--

```{python}
my_courses.append("STA323") # add on an element
my_courses
```

--

```{python}
my_courses.reverse() # change the order
my_courses
```

--

```{python}
my_courses.pop() # remove last element
my_courses
```

---

## Attributes in action

```{python}
x = 4 + 3j
y = 0 + 1J

[x.real, y. real]
[x.imag, y.imag]
```

<br/>

Methods are called similar to functions with `()`; attributes are called similar
to a variable or object. Typing `.` and hitting tab will populate the available
methods and attributes for a given object.

---

## More methods in action

```{python}
my_string = "python is an object oriented programming language"
```

--

```{python}
my_string.title() # title case
my_string.count("o") # count the "o"s
```

--

```{python}
z = (6, 0, 11, 99, -5, 0, 0)
```

--

```{python}
z.index(11) # find position of 11
z.count(0)  # count the 0s
```

---

## Exercises

1. Create a float variable and each of the four built-in data structures
   discussed (list, tuple, dictionary, set). For each object, use a combination
   of two methods or attributes and document in markdown their functionality.
<br/><br/>
2. Set object `dilemma`, given below, to all lowercase. Then, reverse the 
   order of the letters. Lastly, capitalize the first "b".
    ```{python}
    dilemma = "Borrow OR Rob"
    ```
<br/><br/>
*Hint:* `dilemma[start:end:step]`. What does a negative index do?

# Control flow

---

## `if`, `for`, `while`

- The syntax style of control flow in Python is based off `:` and indentations.
  Python does not wrap code blocks for control flow with `{ }` as is
  done in R.

- There is no `switch` statement and no `repeat` statement in Python.

---

## `if`

Syntax:

.small[
```{python, eval=FALSE}
if condition:
  # code block
  # indented
elif another_condition:
  # code block
  # indented
else:
  # code block
  # indented
```
]

--
<br/>

Example:

.small[
```{python}
medical_cost = 180

if medical_cost <= 100:
  bill = medical_cost
elif medical_cost <= 200:
  bill = 100 + (0.5 * (medical_cost - 100))
else:
  bill = 150
  
print("Your total bill is {} dollars.".format(bill))
```
]

---

## `for` loop

Syntax:

```{python, eval=FALSE}
for index in sequence:
  # code to be
  # iterated
  # again, indented
```

--
<br/>

Example:

```{python}
j = 1
for i in "Duke":
  print("Letter {index} is {letter}.\n".format(index = j, letter = i))
  j += 1
```

---

Some more `for` loop examples...

```{python}
squares = []
for i in range(1, 11):
  squares.append(i ** 2)
  
squares
```

--

```{python}
d = {"language": "python", "version": 3.7, 
     "year": 1989, "creator": "Guido van Rossum"}
      
for k, v in d.items():
  print("The key is {}, and its value is {}.".format(k, v))
```

---

## `while` loop

Syntax:

.small[
```{python, eval=FALSE}
while condition:
  # code to be
  # iterated
  # again, indented
```
]

--
<br/>

Example:

.small[
```{python}
j = 100
i = 1.01
while i < j:
  i *= i
  print(round(i, 2))

```
]

---

Some more `while` loop examples...

```{python}
nums = list(range(3))
while nums:
  num_off = nums.pop()
  print("The number {} was removed from the list nums.".format(num_off))

```

--

Python supports `break` statements.

```{python}
my_string = "I'm sleepy, "
i = 1
while True:
  my_string += "z"
  i += 1
  if i > 10:
    break
    
my_string
```

# Functions

---

## Defining a function

As with control flow, Python relies on indentations and `:` for function style
syntax as opposed to `{ }` in R.

.small.pull-left[
```{python}
def func_name(arg1, arg2):
    """
    Docstring starts with a 
    short description.

    May have more 
    information here.

    arg1 = something
    arg2 = something

    Returns something

    Example usage:

    func_name(1, 2)
    
    """
    
    result = arg1 + arg2

    return result
```
]

.small.pull-right[
```{python}
help(func_name)
```
]

---

## Functions in action

```{python}
def is_prime(n):
  """
  This function checks if a number is prime.
  
  n = positive integer
  
  Example:
  
  is_prime(2)
  is_prime(16)
  
  """
  
  if n < 3:
    result = n - 1
  else:
    for i in range(2, n):
      if (n % i) == 0:
        result = False
        break
    else:
      result = True
      
  return bool(result)

```

---

```{python}
help(is_prime)
```

--

.pull-left[
```{python}
is_prime(n = 2)
is_prime(n = 1)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{python}
is_prime(n = 12)
is_prime(n = 13)
```
]

---

## Function scope

```{python, eval=FALSE}
a = 0
b = 1

def my_function():
    print("The value of b here is {}.\n".format(b))
    a = 3
    print("The value of a here is {}.".format(a))

my_function()

print("The value of a here is {}.".format(a))
```

--

```{python, echo=FALSE}
a = 0
b = 1

def my_function():
    print("The value of b here is {}.\n".format(b))
    a = 3
    print("The value of a here is {}.".format(a))

my_function()

print("The value of a here is {}.".format(a))
```

---

## Exercises

    ```{python, echo=FALSE}
    def unique_list(lst):
        x = []
        for i in lst:
            if i not in x:
                x.append(i)
        x.sort()
        x.reverse()
        return x

    ```
    
    ```{python, echo=FALSE}
    def prime_count(k):
      count = 0
      for i in range(1, k + 1):
        count += is_prime(i)
      
      return count

    ```

1. Write a function that takes a list and returns a list of the
   unique elements of the inputted list in descending order. Do this without 
   using `set()`.
    ```{python}
    unique_list([1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5])
    ```
<br/><br/>
2. Write a function that counts the number of
   prime numbers less than or equal to a specified number.
    ```{python}
    prime_count(k = 13)
    prime_count(k = 1000)
    ```

---

## Importing

A module is a single importable Python file whereas a package is made up of 
two or more modules. Both can be imported the same way with the keyword
`import`.

For example, `import math` imports the math module and provides access to
its many functions.

```{python}
import math
math.factorial(5)
math.sqrt(100)
math.log(1)
```


---

## Importing `from`

If you don't want to import all the functions from a module, you can
just import the ones you need with the keyword `from`.


```{python}
from math import factorial, sqrt, log
factorial(5)
sqrt(100)
log(1)
```


This technique eliminates the need to preface each function call with `math.`.

---

## Importing `from`

You can import all functions from a given module by using the `*` operator.
For example,

```{python, eval=FALSE}
from math import *
```

imports all the functions from the `math` module.

However, this is a bad idea as you may have conflicts between your 
object names and function names in the module.

---

## Importing `as`

For brevity, people often give an alias to a package or module on import. This
can be done with the keyword `as`. For example,

```{python}
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Thus, rather than type `matplotlib.pyplot.hist()` a user can type `plt.hist()`. 
There are common conventions for aliases so stick to using those.

---

## Example

Import packages / modules:

```{python}
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In Jupyter notebook you'll want to include the below line of code in a cell
to allow for inline plotting.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
%matplotlib inline
```

---

Let's plot a heatmap based on a 20 by 20 grid of random numbers.

```{python fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
data = np.random.rand(20, 20)
heat = plt.imshow(data)
plt.show()
```

---

## Example

Create a histogram based off of 5000 randomly generated standard normal
variables.

```{python fig.height=3.5, fig.width=6}
norm_rv = st.norm.rvs(loc = 0,scale = 1, size = 5000)
n, bins, patches = plt.hist(x = norm_rv, bins = 20, alpha = .5, color = "purple",
          edgecolor = "black", linewidth = 1.2)
plt.show()
```

---

## Exercises

1. Create a histogram based off of random variables generated from a probability
   distribution of your choice.
<br/><br/>
2. Plot 100 time steps of a simple symmetric random walk that starts at the 
   value 0.

```{python, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
moves = np.random.random(100)
moves[moves < 0.5] = -1
moves[moves >= 0.5] = 1
walk = moves.cumsum()
walk_list = list(walk)
walk_list.insert(0, 0)
plt.plot(walk_list)
plt.show()
```
